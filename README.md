# Financial-Fraud-Detection
Financial Fraud Detection project using machine learning to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments with high precision and recall, showcasing expertise in building and evaluating ML models and data preprocessing.

Are you tired of constantly worrying about financial fraud in your online transactions? Look no further! This project presents a solution to this widespread problem through the use of machine learning.

This repository showcases my expertise in building and evaluating effective machine learning models for fraud detection. The main objective of this project is to train a model that can accurately distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments with high precision and recall.

The project features comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection steps, along with thorough evaluation and performance optimization of the final model. The best model is then deployed in a simple web application, allowing for real-time predictions on new transactions.

Technologies used in this project include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask.

This project demonstrates my ability to solve a real-world problem with machine learning and my attention to detail in the development process. I am confident that my skills and approach to this project will make a positive impact on any organization.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve the project. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
